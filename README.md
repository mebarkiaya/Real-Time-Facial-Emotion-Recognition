# Real-Time-Facial-Emotion-Recognition

Description
This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system. 
It uses deep learning techniques to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality. 
The system is built with the FER-2013 dataset and frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
Emotion classification with deep learning models.
Optimized performance through hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.
Supports emotion detection from both images and video streams.

Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
Dataset: FER-2013
